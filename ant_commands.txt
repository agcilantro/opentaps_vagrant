 run                      This will start OFBiz
 run-debug                Starts OFBiz in debugging mode
 run-install              This loads all configured data; meant for generic OFBiz development, testing, demonstration, etc purposes
 run-install-extseed      This loads seed, seed-initial and ext data; meant for manual/generic testing, development, or going into production with a derived system based on stock OFBiz where the ext data basically replaces the demo data
 run-install-exttest      This loads seed, seed-initial, ext and ext-test data; meant for automated testing with a derived system based on stock OFBiz
 run-install-file         This loads data using the command line argument 'file' to load data from a given file

 run-install-noext        This loads all configured data but does not load the ext files in opentaps/mycompany 
 run-install-readers      This loads data using the command line argument 'data-readers' that takes a comma separated list of readers (seed, seed-initial, demo, ext, ext-test, ext-demo)
 run-install-seed         This loads ONLY the seed data (not seed-initial, demo, ext* or anything else); meant for use after an update of the code to reload the seed data as it is generally maintained along with the code and needs to be in sync for operation
